# DARPA Drone Triage Sensing System

Triage is the practice of categorizing injured victims by a priority level to receive treatment for their injuries. Currently, before the triage process can begin, first responders must search for all injured people throughout the devastated area; once the injured people are located, triage is performed on the injured victims. The problem with this current triage process is that the time spent searching for injured people can mean the difference between life and death for those victims. This is why DARPA has issued a challenge called the DARPA Triage Challenge, or the DTC. The purpose of the DTC is to provide another way to assist medical responders in evaluating the condition of victims of a disaster quickly and efficiently using uncrewed aircraft vehicles, or UAVs, otherwise known as drones [1]. The goal of this project is to make just the sensing system capable of evaluating a person's vitals and then categorizing them by a priority level. The sensing goals for this project will be to measure presence of heartbeat, quantified value of respiratory rate, and cognition testing using voice activity detection (VAD). These components will be used to evaluate the medical state of a person who has fallen victim to a disaster and provide a priority triage level for everyone.


## Executive Summary

During a disaster, speed and efficiency are vital to saving lives. The current method of triage begins with the search for all injured people throughout the devastated area; once the injured people are located, triage is performed on the injured victims. The problem with this current triage process is that the time spent searching for injured people can mean the difference between life and death for those victims. Currently, there is no method available that can scan a large area for disaster victims and can also evaluate their medical condition quickly and effectively. That is why DARPA has issued a challenge called the DARPA Triage Challenge, or the DTC. 
The purpose of the DTC is to provide another way to assist medical responders in evaluating the condition of victims of a disaster, quickly and efficiently utilizing uncrewed aircraft vehicles, or UAVs, otherwise known as drones. For our capstone project, the goal is to develop the sensing system that will eventually be attached to a drone that DARPA requires for their challenge [1]. 
The sensing goals for this project will be to measure the presence of heartbeat, measure breathing rate, use a camera as well as a night vision camera to locate victims as well as determine whether they are able to walk, and to use a speaker and microphone to test if a victim can follow commands. All these components will be used to evaluate the medical state of a person that has fallen victim to a disaster to fulfill the challenges that DARPA has issued [1].



## Capabilities

At the end of this project, we will end up with a functional sensing system that is capable of sorting victims in disaster circumstances based on the START Model. It will be capable of sensing heartbeat and respiratory rate of victims, run that data through an algorithm based directly on the START Model, take an audio input from the victims, run that data through the next part of the algorithm based


## Salient Outcomes

Salient Outcomes will be added here once the sensing system has been fully built and tested. 


## Project Demonstration & Images

We will demonstrate our finished project here at the end of Fall Semester 2023 when the sensing system has been fully built and tested.
