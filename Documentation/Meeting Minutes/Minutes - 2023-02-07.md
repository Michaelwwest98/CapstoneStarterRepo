Raymond contacted Putnam County search and rescue and told them what we were doing and asked if they had anything they thought needed to be added. We split up in 2 groups, 1 group wrote on the format of the project proposal and the other done research. Discussion on if thermal cameras should be used in the project. Due to pricing, we havenâ€™t decided whether to include thermal cameras, possibly only focus on breathing and heart rate. FFA regulations pertaining to the scope of our project were researched. Through some discussion and more research into triage models, the group felt that we needed to go with the START model for our means of triage. Different methods of non-contact sensors for breathing were researched a few mentioned were night vision cameras and RGB cameras. Discussion on the possibility of 2 sensing systems needed depending on day and night, we will see. Decided that speakers should be added to the project. decided that radar should be used to detect heart rates, Texas Instruments automotive AWR was discussed.
