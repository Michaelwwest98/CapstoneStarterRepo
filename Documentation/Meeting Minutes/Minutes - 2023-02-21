Meeting Minutes- 2/21/2023
By Raymond Mule
During this meeting, we decided to split the team into two groups. One team of one person worked on the project proposal presentation, while the remaining four worked on the conceptual design. During the planning of the conceptual design, we discussed how we would organize the block diagram, and we also looked at the additional requirements for the conceptual design. We discussed the multiple components needed that were to go in the block diagram that would make up our entire design. We also discussed how we would organize the remaining meeting times before the deadline. We decided that Thursday will be spent on the conceptual design, and Tuesday of next week shall be spent on the project proposal revisions and presentation.
