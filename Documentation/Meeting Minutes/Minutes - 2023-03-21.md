The group discussed how to go forward since the scope of the project has been changed. The START model was researched more to find out what exactly we need from the subsystems to triage someone based on the START model. The group researched constrains the human body will put on the remaining subsystems so a better picture of what ways we can measure these quantities can be obtained. The timeline was adjusted to remove the time spent on the visual subsystem and the case housing.
