The team is working on re-doing the operational amplifier part of the respiratory/heartbeat subsystem. We are designing the non-inverting op-amp and simulating in
LT-Spice. We care about the frequency range of 0.7 Hz to 3.5 Hz. We have updated our constraints on the op-amp. We are making improvements to the 
BOM. The BOM now has the appropriate sections.
