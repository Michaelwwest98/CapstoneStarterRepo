During this meeting, the group decided a new component that would be able to measure the presence of a heartbeat and a respiratory rate using contactless methods.
Michael did reseaarch on github to ensure that all of the information could be successfully updated. Logan worked on the schematic of the subsystem, and the remaining 
three members did research on the component to be used in the analysis of the detail design.
