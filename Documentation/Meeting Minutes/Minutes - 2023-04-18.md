Today we decided to do further research into the heartbeat and respiratory subsystem in order to become closer to meeting constraints.

We also decided that we should assign one person at a time to do updates to the heartbeat and respiratory subsystem in order to avoid update confusion from multiple people edting different versions of that file and attempting to commit at the same time.

We found that it may take a lot of analysis to get the heartbeat and respiratory signoff to fully meet expectations

We decided that Andrei will handle this analysis and the creation of the new schematic for the heartbeat and respiratory signoff

Updated decision: we decided to edit the heartbeat and respiratory signoff on a Google Doc so that we have a live document that everyone can see, then we will assign someone to convert that data to the github. That way no one is forced to edit this subsystem alone.

We decided to let Raymond create the LTSpice file for the schematic of the operational amplifier circuit
