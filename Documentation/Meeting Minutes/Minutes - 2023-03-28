Our team began discussing the first signoff - detial desin 1. Our first subsystem we are designing is the heartbeat and respiratory system. We are focusing on the function and constraints this meeting.
We will meet later this week to work on the schematic, analysis, and BOM. We created a shared google doc - "Detail Design 1" - to work on the detail design 1 which can be found in the team's discord.
