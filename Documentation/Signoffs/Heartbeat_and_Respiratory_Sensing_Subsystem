Function of the subsystem-

The purpose of this subsystem is to measure the presence of a heartbeat as well as measure the respiratory rate of a person contactlessly. This subsystem will be composed of a singular radar that will perform both of these actions. The measuring of a person’s presence of a heartbeat as well as respiratory rate will be done by measuring the rise and fall rates of a person’s chest to measure the respiratory rate, and the rise and fall rates of the area around the heart to measure the presence of a heartbeat.
