# User Interface Subsytem

## Functionality

The function of this subsystem is to take the data from the wireless communication between the Jetson Nano and a laptop, then to display the data in a way that is useful for responders. Data that should be displayed should include the following: triage results, heartbeat, and respiratory rate data. Triage results should be prioritized as the main result being displayed, with heartbeat data and respiratory data being displayed as secondary data.
